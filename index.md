We believe that crypto has laid the foundation for permissionless digital
institutions that enable humanity to collaborate with unprecedented scope and
scale.

Timewave architects such institutions to bring long-term alignment across the
interchain. We are currently researching, designing, and building tools for 
protocols to effectively manage their internal resources and better cooperate by
lending to one another.

Timewave envisions a world where those who participate in the network economy are limited
only by their imaginations and the laws of physics.
