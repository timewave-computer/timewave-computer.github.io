## The next generation of crypto will be defined by natively <span class="highlight-term" data-cluster="user-experience" data-term="cross-chain-apps">cross-chain applications</span>. If you're building at that frontier, let's talk.

Timewave is an R&D studio for <span class="highlight-term" data-cluster="systems-engineering" data-term="distributed-systems">verifiable distributed systems</span>. Crypto's promise is a single, networked economy built on <span class="highlight-term" data-cluster="governance-systems" data-term="permissionless-institutions">permissionless institutions</span>. We architect the infrastructure that makes this future possible.

Building across blockchains is one of the hardest engineering challenges in crypto today. We know this because we've spent years in the trenches solving it. Our team has built four generations of <span class="highlight-term" data-cluster="architecture-design" data-term="multi-domain-infra">multi-domain infrastructure</span>, tackling everything from <span class="highlight-term" data-cluster="systems-engineering" data-term="async-execution">asynchronous execution</span> to inconsistent security models. Today, we are core contributors and the most demanding super-users of <span class="highlight-term" data-cluster="protocol-framework" data-term="valence-protocol">Valence Protocol</span>, the fastest way to build and scale cross-chain applications.


## We build systems that dissolve the boundaries between blockchains.

Our focus areas span the full spectrum of <span class="highlight-term" data-cluster="market-infrastructure" data-term="interchain-innovation">interchain innovation</span>, from <span class="highlight-term" data-cluster="defi-infrastructure" data-term="protocol-lending">protocol-to-protocol lending</span> to <span class="highlight-term" data-cluster="treasury-management" data-term="liquidity-systems">global liquidity interoperability</span>.

We combine cutting-edge <span class="highlight-term" data-cluster="core-languages" data-term="rust-programming">Rust systems programming</span> with <span class="highlight-term" data-cluster="cryptography" data-term="zk-tech">zero-knowledge cryptography</span> to create <span class="highlight-term" data-cluster="contract-development" data-term="smart-contracts">next-generation smart contracts</span>. Our <span class="highlight-term" data-cluster="testing-infrastructure" data-term="test-framework">comprehensive testing infrastructure</span> ensures reliability across all blockchain networks.
