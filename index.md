## The next generation of crypto will be defined by natively cross-chain applications. If you're building at that frontier, let's talk.

Timewave is an R&D studio for verifiable distributed systems. Crypto's promise is a single, networked economy built on permissionless institutions. We architect the infrastructure that makes this future possible.

Building across blockchains is one of the hardest engineering challenges in crypto today. We know this because we've spent years in the trenches solving it. Our team has built four generations of multi-domain infrastructure, tackling everything from asynchronous execution to inconsistent security models. Today, we are core contributors and the most demanding super-users of [Valence Protocol](https://www.valence.zone/), the fastest way to build and scale cross-chain applications. 


## We build systems that dissolve the boundaries between blockchains.
